# SRB2Kart - Which DLLs do I need to bundle?

Updated 8/23/2020 (v1.3)

Here are the required DLLs, per build. For each architecture, copy all the binaries from these folders:

* libs\dll-binaries\[i686/x86_64]
* libs\SDL2\[i686/x86_64]...\bin
* libs\SDL2_mixer\[i686/x86_64]...\bin
* libs\libopenmpt\[x86/x86_64]...\bin\mingw

and don't forget to build r_opengl.dll for srb2dd.
